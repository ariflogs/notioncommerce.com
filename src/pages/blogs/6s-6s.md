Getting inspired by [Pieter Level's](https://twitter.com/levelsio) [12 startups in 12 months](https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months) and platforms like [#BuildSell30](https://mobile.twitter.com/BuildSell30), I wanted to kind of do the same. But being a student with a full-time job, I can't devote that much time to launch a product in such a short period of time!!

<br/>

But like most other students I also get 2-3 weeks of semester break, 3 times a year! and technically I have 2 more years to complete my degree, So I may just be able to launch 6 products in 6 semester breaks and hopefully can generate some revenue from them.
Therefore, I won't have to depend on salaries after I graduate!

<br />
Ok, Here's the plan. I will code like "running a 100m race" during the semester breaks to launch a product. And during the semester "run on a marathon" to do things like research, marketing, bug fixing & feature updates.

(Note: even though I'm announcing this now, I actually started this last semester and already launched a product! So let's just assume I'm from the past)
