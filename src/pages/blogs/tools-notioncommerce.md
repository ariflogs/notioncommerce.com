I’m really grateful for being born in this age where there’s so many tools available that starting a business have never been easier. ✌️ Thought one can argue low barrier to entry creates more competition, to growing is becoming more difficult! But that’s a separate discussion.

Coming back to my topic, I launched [NotionCommerce](http://notioncommerce.com) with help of some amazing tools. Shoutout to them for offering generous free tiers.
