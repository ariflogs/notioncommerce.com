Ok, I admit I'm a student and some of my reasoning might be biased! So read with caution ðŸ˜¶

I guess you know that bashing on college/uni has become a norm, Which definitely they deserve & I'm also guilty of doing so. But besides doing full-time jobs & indie hacking on the side, I'm still studying computer science at Uni. And I decided not to drop out either.

<br/>
Why? Well, I actually made e list ðŸ‘‡

<br/>
<br/>

ðŸ‘‰ The biggest reasoning I hear against college is the content you learn there is totally free online. Which is 100% true, If just learning about your field is your only priority then college will definitely not be for you.
But as I realised in the past couple of years that college isn't actually for learning! It's more about the experience!

<br/>

ðŸ‘‰ You get to know different learners, make friends, do networking, and have weird & fun memories.

<br/>

ðŸ‘‰ Being around a large amount of hard-working young people is a privilege. I truly get motivated seeing some of my classmates working hard. Whether it is for getting good grades/running a small business/preparing for a competition.

<br/>

ðŸ‘‰ When You have to schedule yourself for different classes, and exams besides your own personal things (Hobbies/Job/Business..) You learn a lot about time management.

<br/>

ðŸ‘‰ Paying tuition fees every semester hurt a lot, but In a way, it kind of pushed me to manage money better.

<br/>

ðŸ‘‰ It's a great phase for exploring different stuff.
I'm quite certain I will run businesses as a career, but I'm don't wanna just quit everything and go all in right now. I'm using this student phase as an opportunity to explore things that I care about, whether it is programming/ marketing/ writing/ making videos/ audience building/ gardening or cooking. And tbh I also wanna try out standup comedy sometime next year. Coz why not? In general, you have so less responsibilities as a student and plenty of opportunities to explore.

<br/>

ðŸ‘‰ Graduating can be a great way to give your parents a sense of pride. I don't know if it's just an Asian parent's thing, but my parents really wanna see me graduate.

<br/>

Now of course this ar just my own "positive" experience and I'm not saying anyone should do college or drop out. I just wanted to share some of my good experiences with college after bashing it all my life. ðŸ˜¶
